I'm Kamran Ansari, with over 8 years of diverse experience across the travel industry and data analytics. My professional journey began in the travel sector, where I honed my skills for nearly 5 years. However, the COVID-19 pandemic prompted a career shift, leading me to the dynamic field of data analytics.

I work as a Lead Analyst for an MNC and here are my humble contributions:

Identified major KPIs for various Clients, which have helped systems assess their performance.

Created multiple product-related dashboards with automated refresh and continuous data feed leading to a reduction in manual data extraction workload. These dashboards helped to identify the percentage of missing data in the database which is critical for proper diagnosis

I am more data-informed than data-driven. I want my data to tell stories that are relatable, understandable, and actionable which would aid data-informed business decisions.
